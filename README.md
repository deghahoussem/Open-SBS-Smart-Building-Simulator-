# Open-SBS (Smart-Building-Simulator)

In this section, we will present our Open-SBS smart home simulator. Open-SBS includes an extensible library of smart devices that facilitates the simulation of current and future smart home environments. Open-SBS simulate the smart home compartment and human activities using our ontology-driven simulation-based approach. Open-SBS allow researchers to design their virtual smart homes, create scenarios, the configuration environment of simulation, like weather, energy sources, and others. also, allow generating results of simulation such as sharps of tracking energy consumption, smart home datasets.

## Requirment to run Open-SBS : 

- Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 1.8)
- Java SE Runtime Environment 8 (JRE 1.8)
- Eclipse IDE Oxygen for Java
- Protege-OWL API 
- e(fx)clipse - JavaFX Tooling and Runtime for Eclipse
